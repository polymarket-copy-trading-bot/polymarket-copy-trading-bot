## Overview

This bot monitors selected Polymarket wallets in real time and **automatically mirrors their trades**.  

Perfect for users who want a **simple, fast, and reliable** copy-trading setup.

## Core Features

### 1. Real-Time Wallet Mirroring

The bot continuously watches target wallets:

- Detects trades instantly  
- Identifies event, direction, and stake  
- Executes mirrored trades within milliseconds  
- Uses asynchronous processing for maximum speed  

---

### 2. Position Scaling

Choose how the bot sizes your trades:

**Proportional Mode:**
```

YourStake = (YourBank / TraderBank) × TraderStake

```

**Fixed Allocation Mode:**
```

Always bet $X per trade

```

Includes:
- Min/max trade size  
- Liquidity checks  
- Event-level exposure limits  

---

### 3. Multi-Wallet Copying

Copy multiple wallets at once.  
You can set:

- Equal weights  
- Custom weights  
- Per-wallet limits  

The bot will open/close positions in sync with each tracked wallet.

---

### 4. Fail-Safe Execution Layer

Built for reliability:

- No duplicate trades  
- Automatic retries  
- Handles Polymarket API interruptions  
- Auto-exit when the original wallet exits the position
